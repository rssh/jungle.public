  Plugin for automatic build of depended components, situated somewhere near in the same source tree.
 </span> 
Imagine complex project, which consists from set of components, partially depended from each others. Each component is a ivy project, which can be depends from other components of the same framework. 
</p>
<p>
Problem is to build all from scratch: we need at first build dependencies, publish ones to repository, than build dependencies which depends from 'bottom' dependencies .... up to out top project. This resolver do build and publishing of depended components in such cases. With this plugin we can get entire source tree and build any component with one command.

</p>


<h1>Attributes</h1>
This resolver shares the <a href="../settings/resolvers.html#common">common attributes</a> of standard resolvers, plus the following:
<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-att">Attribute</th><th class="ivy-att-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-att-req">Required</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>buildResolverDir</td>
    <td>Directory which passed to build of dependencies in ${ivy.build.resolver.dir}  </td>
    <td>No; defaults to none</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>resolveFirst</td>
    <td>Force build only if artefact is not found in cache.</td>
    <td>No; defaults to true</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>verbose</td>
    <td>Verbose output</td>
    <td>No; defaults to false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>quiet</td>
    <td>True to run ant with the -quiet flag</td>
    <td>No; defaults to false</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>

<h1>Child elements</h1>
<table class="ivy-children">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-chld">Element</th><th class="ivy-chld-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-chld-card">Cardinality</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr><td>resolver</td><td>Defines a resolver (usially reference to file resolver), where child builds must publish their artifacts</td>
    <td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>dependencyBuild</td><td>Define dependency build</td>
    <td>1..n</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 And dependency build have next attributes:
<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-att">Attribute</th><th class="ivy-att-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-att-req">Required</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>organization</td>
    <td>organization of dependency module</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>name of dependency module</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>buildDirectory</td>
    <td>directory, where source of dependency module is situated</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>antFile</td>
    <td>build file for dependency build</td>
    <td>No. Default is <i>build.xml</i> </td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>publishTarget</td>
    <td>target for dependency build</td>
    <td>No. Default is <i>publish</i> </td>
   </tr>
</table>


<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>
 Let our directory structure looks like:
<pre>
projects/
  A/
   ... project A ...
  B/
   ... project B ...
  C/
   ... project C ...
repo-dir/
   ...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
 and in ivysetting.xml file in project C we configured 'local' and 'build'
resolvers:
<code type="xml">
 <resolvers>
  <filesystem name="local">
     <ivy pattern="${ivy.build.resolver.dir}/[organisation]/[module]/ivys/ivy-[revision].xml"/>
     <artifact pattern="${ivy.build.resolver.dir}/[organisation]/[module]/[type]s/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>    
  </filesystem>
  <build name="build.local" buildResolverDir="${ivy.build.resolver.dir}" >     
     <resolver ref="local" />
     <dependencyBuild  organization="ua.gradsoft" name="A" buildDirectory="${ivy.settings.dir}/../A" publishTarget="publish.local" />
     <dependencyBuild  organization="ua.gradsoft" name="B" buildDirectory="${ivy.settings.dir}/../B" publishTarget="publish.local" />
  </build>
 </resolvers>
</code>
</p>
 Now, when we build <i> C </i> and <i> A </i> or <i> B </i> does not yet published to <code> ${ivy.build.resolver.dir} </code> then build resolver will call publish.local targets in appropriative build directories.
</p>

<h1>Build-time properties</h1>
This resolver pass next ant properties to dependency build.
<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-att">Property</th><th class="ivy-att-desc">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>ivy.build.resolver.dir</td>
    <td>Defined as 'ivyBuildResolverDir' attribute. Usially used as name of directory, where to publish dependency artifacts.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
